    "1.\tExplain the concept of file modes in Python. Provide a brief description of at least three file modes commonly used in file handling. How does the choice of mode affect the way a file is opened and processed?\n",
    "-> In Python, file modes specify operations when opening files. 'r' (Read) reads content from the file. 'w' (Write) truncates and writes new data, potentially overwriting the file. 'a' (Append) adds content to the end without truncation. These modes affect file positioning, content preservation, and creation behavior. Caution is advised, especially with 'w' mode, to prevent unintended data loss. The `with` statement ensures proper file closure after operations.\n",

    "2.\tDiscuss the difference between writing and appending to a file in Python. When would you choose one over the other? Provide an example scenario where appending to a file is more suitable than writing to it.\n",
    "-> In Python, writing to a file ('w' mode) truncates existing content and overwrites it, while appending ('a' mode) adds data to the end without truncation. Choose 'w' for creating or completely rewriting a file, and 'a' for adding content without erasing existing data. For example, when maintaining a log file, 'a' is suitable to continuously append new entries, ensuring preservation of historical data, whereas 'w' would reset the log each time, leading to data loss.\n",

    "3.\tEnumerate and explain three best practices for proper file handling in Python. Consider aspects such as opening and closing files, error handling, and resource management.\n",
    "-> \n",
    "1. **Use the `with` Statement:** Employ the `with` statement to ensure proper file closure, enhancing resource management and preventing potential issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exception Handling:** Implement try-except blocks to handle potential errors during file operations, improving robustness and preventing program crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Specify File Encoding:** Explicitly define the file encoding (e.g., 'utf-8') when opening files to avoid unexpected character encoding issues, promoting consistent data handling across platforms. These practices enhance reliability, maintainability, and resource efficiency in Python file handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tDiscuss the potential consequences of not closing a file explicitly. How does Python handle file closing when using the with statement, and why is it considered a good practice in file handling?\n",
    "-> Not closing a file explicitly in Python can lead to resource leaks and unexpected behavior. When a file is not closed, it may remain locked, preventing other processes from accessing or modifying it. This can result in data corruption or loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement in Python automatically closes the file when the associated block is exited, even if an exception occurs. This ensures proper resource management, preventing memory leaks and potential issues with file locks. Explicit closure using `with` is considered good practice, enhancing code readability, reliability, and reducing the likelihood of bugs related to unclosed files."
