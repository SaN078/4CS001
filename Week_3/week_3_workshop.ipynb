    "1) How can you use logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to combine multiple conditions in a control flow statement, and what are some common use cases for this type of logic?\n",
    "-Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) combine conditions in control flow statements. AND requires both conditions true, OR needs at least one, and NOT negates a condition. They're crucial for creating complex decision structures, input validation, and state checking in programming.\n",
    "2) What is a \"nested control flow statement,\" and how can you use it to create more complex logic in your program?\n",
    "-A \"nested control flow statement\" involves placing one control flow statement within another. This allows for more intricate logic by executing conditions based on the outcome of inner statements. It's commonly used in programming to create complex decision structures and handle various scenarios within a program.\n",
    "3) Describe the concept of \"chaining\" if-else statements together, and explain the advantages and disadvantages of this approach over using nested if statements.\n",
    "-\"Chaining\" if-else statements involves linking multiple conditions sequentially. Advantages include simplicity and readability, as each condition is evaluated independently. Disadvantages include reduced clarity for complex scenarios and potential inefficiency, as all conditions are checked, even if an earlier one is true. Nested if statements can offer more precise control but may lead to code indentation and decreased readability. Choosing between them depends on the specific logic requirements and code organization.\n",
    "4) Explain the concept of \"scope\" in programming, and how it relates to control flow statements like \"if-else\". What are some common scope-related issues that can arise in programming, and how can you avoid or troubleshoot them?\n",
    "-\"Scope\" in programming defines the region where a variable or identifier is accessible. In control flow statements like \"if-else,\" variables may have local or global scope, affecting their visibility. Common scope-related issues include variable shadowing, where a local variable hides a global one, and unexpected changes in variable values due to scope changes. To avoid issues, use meaningful variable names, minimize global variables, and understand the scope rules of the programming language. Debugging tools, like print statements or a debugger, help identify and resolve scope-related problems.\n",
    "5) Evaluate and write the output of the following expressions for num1 = 10 and num2 = 20.\n",
    "(a) not(num1 < 1) and num2 < 10\n",
    "-False\n",
    "(b) not(num1 < 1) and num2 < 10 or num1 + num3 < 100 \n",
    "-True\n",
    "(c) not(num2 > 1) or num1 > num2 - 10\n",
